I want to start getting more serious about fitness. Need some advice on workout routines.

I'm 34, work a desk job in Pune - software engineer, so I'm sitting most of the day. My back has been bothering me lately because of all the sitting.

I used to play cricket regularly in college, but haven't been very active in the last 5-6 years. I can still run a bit, but I get tired quickly now.

I wake up at 6 AM usually, and I'm most energetic in the mornings. By evening, I'm just exhausted from work.

I have a small home gym setup - just dumbbells (5kg and 10kg), a yoga mat, and resistance bands. No treadmill or fancy equipment.

My wife Meera does yoga every morning at 6:30 AM in our living room, so I need to work out either before that or in a different room.

I'm vegetarian, but I do eat dairy - paneer, milk, yogurt, all that. I've heard protein is important for building muscle?

Honestly, I can commit to maybe 30-45 minutes max on weekdays. Weekends I have more time, maybe an hour or so.

My goal is to lose this belly fat - I've gained about 8 kgs in the last 3 years. Also want to fix my posture and strengthen my back.

Can you suggest a beginner workout plan that fits my schedule and equipment?

Hey! I've been following that workout plan and I'm feeling much better. My back pain has reduced significantly!

Now I want to focus more on nutrition. Can you create a weekly meal plan for me? I want to make sure I'm eating right to support my workouts and weight loss goal.

[Should automatically create meal plan considering:]
- Vegetarian with dairy
- Protein requirements for muscle building
- Weight loss goal (8kg to lose)
- Morning workout schedule (post-workout nutrition)
- Working professional (meal prep considerations)
WITHOUT asking user to repeat any dietary or lifestyle information
