Hey! I'm looking for suggestions for our Holi long holiday trip this year. We have about 5 days off from Mar 4th to Mar 8th.

It's me, my wife Priya, and our two kids - Aarav who's 8 years old and Diya who just turned 5.

Aarav absolutely loves beaches and swimming - he's been taking lessons for 2 years now. Diya is scared of water but she enjoys building sandcastles and playing in the sand.

My wife is strictly vegetarian - no eggs, no fish, nothing. But I and the kids, we're fine with everything.

We typically stay in family resorts because they have kids' clubs and play areas. Keeps the little ones entertained while we get some relaxation time!

Our usual budget is around ₹80,000 to ₹1,00,000 for the entire trip - that includes flights, stay, food, everything.

We're based in Bangalore, so I prefer direct flights. The kids get restless on long layovers.

Oh, and we always book through MakeMyTrip - been using them for years, never had issues. I have an account registered with myaccount@gmail.com and mobile number +91-9876543210.

I've actually narrowed it down to three places in my mind - Goa, Kerala, or Andaman Islands. All three have beaches which the kids would love. Goa has more happening places and water sports. Kerala is more peaceful with backwaters. Andaman has pristine beaches but flights are longer.

What do you think would work best for our family - especially considering Aarav loves swimming, Diya needs gentle beach areas, and Priya's vegetarian food requirements? Also factor in that we have only 10 days and prefer direct flights from Bangalore.

That's really helpful analysis! I'm leaning towards Kerala based on what you said. Let me discuss with Priya and the kids tonight and I'll get back to you.

Hi! I'm planning Aarav's birthday celebration next weekend and we want to do a special dinner. The kids are super excited!

When we eat out, we usually go to family-friendly restaurants - you know, places with a relaxed vibe, not too formal. We're in Chennai, so plenty of options around.

Budget-wise for a nice family dinner, we're comfortable spending around ₹4,000-5,000. We eat out most weekends.

Oh, and we sometimes look for places that have some play area or at least space for kids to move around. Keeps them entertained!

Can you suggest some good restaurants in Chennai for the birthday celebration? Also, let me know why each would be a good fit based on what each of us in the family would enjoy.

Important user preference: Priya is vegetarian, so the system should suggest restaurants with vegetarian food.
