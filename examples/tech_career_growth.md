### **SEMANTIC/PERSONAL DATA Example - Tech Career Growth**

**Conversation 1:**

I need advice on my career path.

I'm a backend developer, 3 years experience, working at TCS in Bangalore. Current CTC is ₹7 LPA.

I'm good at what I do, but the project is boring - legacy system maintenance for a banking client. No modern tech, no learning.

I mostly work with Java and Python - built several REST APIs, worked on data processing pipelines, automated deployment scripts. I've also been learning Docker and Kubernetes basics because I'm interested in moving towards DevOps eventually.

I'm looking to switch jobs and also want to improve my skills in the DevOps direction - cloud platforms, CI/CD, containerization, that sort of thing.

What should be my strategy for career transition? Should I switch to a DevOps role directly or take a backend role with DevOps responsibilities?

What’s your highest recommendation from the offer letters above?
